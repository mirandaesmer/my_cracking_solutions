        # stack when the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a
        # data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetO-fStacks should be
        # composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the
        # previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks. push() and SetOfStacks.

        # should return the same values as it would if there were just a single
        # stack).

        # Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation
        # on a specific sub-stack.
